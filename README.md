A set of react components that act as a logic container wrapping your d3 chart...

A placeholder for a notional set of React utilities to be used when you want to create dynamic, responsive, interactive D3 visualisations inside of a React app.

Currently in development, will require React version 16.0.0 or greater.

Football example simple illustrates the D3 'General Update Pattern' - which is a source of great confusion for everyone starting out with D3.js. It doesn't have to be so hard; this visualisation, in conjunction with the code base, should give you enough of an understanding of the pattern to start creating dynamic interactive visualisations of your own, with ever changing data sets.
